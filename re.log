I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.

! Improper \spacefactor.

You can refer to \spacefactor only in horizontal mode;
you can refer to \prevdepth only in vertical mode; and
neither of these is meaningful inside \write. So
I'm forgetting what you said and using zero instead.

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
